# Contributing to DatasynxOpenCRM

Thanks for your interest in improving `@datasynx/agentic-crm`. This guide
covers everything you need to land a high-quality change.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js ≥ 20** and npm
- Git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datasynx/datasynx-crm.git
cd datasynx-crm
npm ci
```

## Development Workflow

This project follows **Test-Driven Development**. The non-negotiables:

1. **Write the failing test first.** No production code without a test that
   first fails for the right reason. Tests live in `__tests__/`, mirroring
   `src/` (e.g. `__tests__/commands/ticket.test.ts` ↔ `src/commands/ticket.ts`).
2. **Keep the suite green.** `npm test` must exit 0 before every commit.
3. **Document as you go.** A feature isn't done until the docs are updated —
   see "Documentation" below.
4. **English only.** All code, comments, docs, tests, commit messages, and
   user-facing strings must be in English (see the Language Policy in
   `CLAUDE.md`). `npm run check:language` enforces this in CI.

### Useful scripts

| Command                 | Purpose                                                               |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm test`              | Run the full Vitest suite                                             |
| `npm run test:watch`    | Watch mode                                                            |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Coverage (critical path 100%, utilities ≥ 80%)                        |
| `npm run typecheck`     | `tsc` type checking (strict)                                          |
| `npm run lint`          | ESLint (zero warnings allowed)                                        |
| `npm run knip`          | Dead code, unused exports & unused dependencies (zero issues allowed) |
| `npm run format`        | Prettier write                                                        |
| `npm run build`         | Build the distributable with tsdown                                   |
| `npm run docs:generate` | Regenerate the CLI/MCP reference docs from code                       |
| `npm run docs:check`    | Verify all relative doc links/anchors resolve (offline)               |
| `npm run check:language`| Flag non-English (German) stopwords in tracked files (English-only)   |
| `npm run check:deps`    | Block deprecated transitive dependencies from re-entering the tree    |
| `npm run check:install-scripts` | Block dependencies that run unreviewed native install/postinstall scripts |
| `npm run check:onnx-web` | Assert `onnxruntime-web` stays unused on the transformers Node path (#93) |
| `npm run check:no-sourcemaps` | Block `.map` files from the published package (run after `npm run build`) |

### Native install scripts

A few dependencies run lifecycle install/postinstall scripts to build or fetch
native binaries. We keep this surface explicit and auditable:

| Package | Why it runs a script |
| --- | --- |
| `sharp` | libvips native build — image preprocessing for local embeddings (transitive via `@huggingface/transformers`) |
| `onnxruntime-node` | downloads the native ONNX runtime binary — local embeddings (transitive via `@huggingface/transformers`) |
| `protobufjs` | protobuf codegen postinstall (transitive via `onnxruntime-web`) |
| `tesseract.js` | OpenCollective funding notice only — **no** native build (direct dep, OCR) |

Policy: pinned exact versions (`.npmrc` `save-exact=true`) + `npm ci` lockfile
integrity + the `npm run check:install-scripts` allowlist. We do **not** use
`--ignore-scripts`, because the embeddings and OCR features need those native
binaries built at install time. `check:install-scripts` fails CI if a new
install-script package enters the tree; review it and add it to
`ALLOWED_INSTALL_SCRIPTS` in `scripts/check-install-scripts.ts` with a reason, or
remove the dependency. Two deprecated upstream-only transitives (`boolean`,
`node-domexception`) are knowingly accepted and tracked — see
`scripts/check-deprecated-deps.ts` and issue #87.

### Post-build integration tests

The Vitest suite runs against a **mocked filesystem** (`memfs`, see
`__tests__/setup.ts`), which keeps unit tests fast and hermetic but means they
can't catch bugs that only surface in the _real_ built `dist/` layout — e.g. a
bundler change that moves where `init` ends up and breaks the resolved
`dist/mcp.js` path. Those invariants are covered by standalone Node scripts that
run against the actual build in CI's **Build & Validate** stage (after
`npm run build`):

| Script                           | Verifies                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `__tests__/e2e/consumer-esm.mjs` | The built package imports as ESM with its public exports                                                                                       |
| `__tests__/e2e/consumer-cjs.cjs` | The built package requires as CJS                                                                                                              |
| `__tests__/e2e/install-init.mjs` | `dxcrm init` writes an MCP server path that actually exists on disk (regression for [#25](https://github.com/datasynx/datasynx-crm/issues/25)) |

Run them locally after a build, e.g. `npm run build && node __tests__/e2e/install-init.mjs`.

### Before you open a PR

```bash
npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run knip && npm run format:check && npm run docs:check && npm run check:language && npm run check:deps && npm run check:install-scripts && npm run check:onnx-web && npm test && npm run build && npm run check:no-sourcemaps
```

A Husky pre-commit hook runs `lint-staged`, and a commit-msg hook enforces
Conventional Commits — so a clean local run means CI will be clean too.

## Documentation

The published reference (`docs/cli-reference.md`, `docs/mcp-tools.md`,
`docs/index.html`) is **generated from code**. If you add or change a CLI
command or MCP tool:

1. Give every command a `.description()` and every tool an entry in the
   `Available Tools` table in `src/mcp/capabilities.ts`.
2. Run `npm run docs:generate` and commit the result.

The drift-guard test (`__tests__/docs/docs-coverage.test.ts`) fails CI if a
command or tool is missing from the docs, so this can't be forgotten.

## Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) — releases
and the changelog are generated from them via semantic-release.
